# Technova API Management

## üß† Overview

Technova is a modular, scalable and secure RESTful API designed to manage users, products, sales and purchases. It includes authentication via JWT, email verification, and invoice generation. Built with NestJS, TypeORM and Domain-Driven Design principles.

## üöÄ Features

### üë§ Users
- Login and JWT authentication
- User creation and profile updates
- Password change and email verification
- Soft deletion of accounts

### üì¶ Products
- Seller product creation, update and soft deletion
- Public product listing with filters (brand, category, price range)

### üí∞ Sales
- Purchase creation and invoice generation
- Buyer and seller views of sales history

## üß± Architecture

This project follows clean architecture principles and advanced design patterns:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clear separation between domain logic, infrastructure and presentation.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Read and write operations are handled independently.
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts persistence logic from business rules.
- **Mapper Pattern**: Transforms data between entities, domain models and DTOs.
- **Validation Layer**: DTOs with class-validator and sanitization against XSS.
- **Soft Delete Pattern**: Logical deletion using status flags.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Role-based access control with guards and decorators.
